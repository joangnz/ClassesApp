This is a really basic console application I made in 2024. To run it, open the x64 folder, and then in Debug, run the .exe file.

Firstly, you can choose from 3 characters, each with their own stats. Then, your character is spawned in a map as an 8, and there are two encounters possible, each represented with a different number.

After pressing space in close enough distance from an encounter, you're prompted to fight.
While fighting, you can cycle 4 different options (with A and D) - Fight, Talk, Mercy and Flee.
Talk and Flee are simple chance-based actions that, if lucky enough, end the battle inmediately.
Mercy depends on whether or not the enemy has >30% HP remaining
Fight prompts the user with an Undertale-like strength meter, where you have to press the spacebar at the middle in order to deal the highest damage.

After an action does not end the battle, the enemy attacks, leaving the user a bit of time to react and move to a position to avoid the attack.

This was all pretty basic work I did on my own by playing around with the Windows Console and its environment during my first year of Web Development (early 2025).

The code does have some mistakes and has a few bugs, as I stopped working on it to focus on the tasks my course was handing out.
